moral: Some objectives may be locked in a stalemate, not worth staying for.

A Fox one day spied a beautiful Tree of Life hanging from a vine trained along the edge of Hotel. The tree seemed ready to burst with life, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.

The tree hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to fight for it. The first time he jumped he got chased off by another player. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to be contested by yet another party. Again and again he tried, but in vain.

Now he sat down and looked at the tree in disgust.

"What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour trees that are not worth gaping for."

And off he walked very, very scornfully.
