Two Duo Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was the Ancient Tree.

"How useless is the Ancient Tree!" said one of them. "It bears no Tree of Life whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves."

"Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the Ancient Tree. "Maybe come here at night when I spawn!"
