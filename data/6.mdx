A certain Father had a family of Sons, who were forever quarreling among themselves. No words he could say did the least good, so he cast about in his mind for some very striking example that should make them see that discord would lead them to misfortune.

One day when the quarreling had been much more violent than usual and each of the Sons was moping in a surly manner, he asked one of them to bring him a bundle of sticks. Then handing the bundle to each of his Sons in turn he told them to try to finish their builds. But although each one tried his best, none was able to do so by the first day.

The Father then took the bundle and asked his Sons to do their builds. This they did very easily.

"My Sons," said the Father, "do you not see how much faster it is to build when sticks do not clog up your inventory?"
