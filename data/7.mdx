Two Travelers were walking along the Beach. Far out they saw something landing near the waves.

"Look," said one, "a gold airdrop rides in from distant lands, bearing Prominence!"

The object they saw came ever nearer the shore.

"No," said the other, "that is not Prominence!. Those are some Smart Bombs, with that, securing us the final zone!"

Still nearer came the object. The waves washed it up on shore.

"It is Boots of Hermes!," they cried. Both Travelers rushed to the beach, but there they found nothing but EOD Boots.
