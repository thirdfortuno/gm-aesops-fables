A certain man who visited foreign servers could talk of little when he returned to his home except the wonderful adventures he had met with and the great deeds he had done abroad.

One of the feats he told about was a build he had made in Ranked. That build was so great, he said, that no other man could place anywhere near him. A great many persons in Ranked had seen him do it and would prove that what he told was true.

"No need of witnesses," said one of the hearers. "Suppose this server is Ranked. Now show us how fast you can build."
